        <h3 class="gray">Take joint responsibility.</h3> 

        <p>Focus intentionally on reducing racial disparities (not just on general system improvement) without placing blame on particular system stakeholders. Encourage local and state leaders to make DMC reduction a long-term priority.</p>

        <h3 class="gray">Work together.</h3> 

        <p>Affiliate with national juvenile justice reform initiatives to learn best practices that can be applied in their local jurisdiction. Increase collaboration across police, courts, and the community to minimize the number of youth who are incarcerated.</p>
        
        <h3 class="gray">Change the conversation.</h3> 

        <p>Move away from a punitive culture to one that focuses on whatâ€™s best for the youth and community by creating and investing in alternatives to secure detention, secure confinement, and formal system involvement.</p>

        <h2 class="red" id="illinois">What can Illinois do?</h2>

        <p>To effectively reduce DMC in Cook County, there must be a long-term commitment by system policy-makers, business leaders, young people and the community to work together to ensure the juvenile justice system is equitable for everyone. This will involve explicity addressing the issue of race, raising awareness of bias and having an intentional focus on reducing racial disparities.</p>

        <p>Funding (both public and private) should be invested in rehabilitative treatment and service providers who can address youth needs in their local community, not in punitive, traditional measures such as detention centers and youth prisons.</p>

        <p>The focus of these programs should be on rehabilitating young people and helping them to achieve positive outcomes that will enable them to become law-abiding adults.</p>

        <p>Funding should be provided to ensure equitable access to necessary services for ALL youth, regardless of their race, age, sex, address, sexual orientation or place of residence.</p>

        <p>Law enforcement officers, school officials and others in the justice system should receive training that will raise their awareness of implicit bias and the impact it has on youth of color and also receive information about available alternatives to arrest.</p>
