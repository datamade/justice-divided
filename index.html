                <p>This disparity is called <strong>disproportionate minority contact</strong>. It has been recognized for decades as a deep-rooted problem of the juvenile justice system.</p>

                <p>Researchers say the divide stems from bias in police and courts. It matters because contact with the justice system puts youth at a persistent disadvantage, affecting their ability to get an education, find housing, and go to work.</p>

                <p>It's <strong>#NotJusticeWhen</strong> the system harms one group significantly more than another.</p>

                <!--In 2014, there were 14,093 arrests of black youth from a population of 109,497, a probability of 0.129 or a rate of 12.9%. There were 17,724 total juvenile arrests from a population of 261,120, a probability of .068 or a rate of 6.8%.

                When we divide 0.129 by 0.068, we see black youth were arrested 1.9 times more often than youth in general.-->
