                <p>This disparity is called <strong>disproportionate minority contact</strong>. It has been recognized for decades as a deep-rooted problem of the juvenile justice system.</p>

                <p>Researchers say the divide stems from bias in police and courts. It matters because contact with the justice system puts youth at a persistent disadvantage, affecting their ability to get an education, find housing, and go to work.</p>

                <p>It's <strong>#NotJusticeWhen</strong> the system harms one group significantly more than another.</p>
