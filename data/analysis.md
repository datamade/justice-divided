## Arrests

There is a marked disparity in many districts between racial makeup of the population and racial makeup of juveniles arrested.

There is also an incongruency between where graffiti occurs and where juveniles are arrested for vandalism, in particular in North Side district **14 - Shakespeare**, which has had the third-highest number of graffiti removal calls since 2011 compared to a relatively low number of arrests for vandalism.
