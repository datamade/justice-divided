## 1. a. Youth in majority-black neighborhoods are arrested at a disproportionately high rate.

### i. Seven of the nine majority-black police districts are among 10 where most arrests occur. 

<<>>=
exec_psql("""
    SELECT
      met.dist_num, 
      dist_name, 
      pct_black, 
      total_pop, 
      num_arrests, 
      RANK() OVER(ORDER BY num_arrests DESC) AS arrest_rank 
    FROM police_district_metadata AS met 
    JOIN arrests_by_district AS arr
      ON met.dist_num = arr.dist_num""")
@

### ii. Arrests totals by district are widely dispersed.

<<>>=
exec_psql("""
    psql -d jdiv -c 'COPY (SELECT num_arrests FROM arrests_by_district) TO STDOUT' | 
    csvstat -H""")
@

## 1. b. Even in districts that are not predominantly black, juveniles arrested are.

### i. There are nine police districts where over half the population is black.

<<>>=
exec_psql("select count(*) from police_district_metadata where pct_black >= 50")
@

There are 17 where over half of juveniles arrested are black. 

<<>>=
exec_psql("select count(*) from district_profiles where pct_arrests_black >= 50")
@

### ii. In majority non-white districts, there is a marked difference between racial makeup of the district and racial makeup of juveniles who are arrested.

<<>>=
exec_psql("""
    SELECT
      dist_num,
      dist_name,
      pct_arrests_black,
      pct_pop_black,
      pct_arrests_black::numeric - pct_pop_black AS pop_arrest_diff
    FROM district_profiles
    WHERE pct_pop_black < 50
    ORDER BY pop_arrest_diff DESC""")
@

## 2. a. Youth from majority-black neighborhoods are overrepresented among youth arrested for a dime bag or less of marijuana.

### i. “Drug abuse violations” was the number one charge for which juveniles were arrested in 2014.

<<>>=
exec_psql("""
    SELECT 
      offense, 
      num_misdemeanor, 
      num_felony, 
      num_other, 
      mf_ratio, 
      total 
    FROM charge_totals 
    LIMIT 5""")
@

### iii. There were more misdemeanor drug arrests than felony drug arrests.

<<>>=
exec_psql("""
    SELECT 
      SUM(felony) AS felonies, 
      SUM(misdemeanor) AS misdemeanors 
    FROM charges_2014 
    WHERE offense LIKE 'DRUG%'""")
@

### iv. Youth from majority black neighborhoods – a quarter of Chicago's population – accounted for over half of misdemeanor drug arrests.

<<>>=
exec_psql("""
    SELECT
      SUM(CASE WHEN pct_black >= 50 THEN misdemeanor END) AS majority_black,
      SUM(CASE WHEN pct_black < 50 THEN misdemeanor END) AS majority_non_black
    FROM charges_2014 AS v
    JOIN police_district_metadata AS met
      ON v.dist_num = met.dist_num
    WHERE offense LIKE 'DRUG%'""")
@

## 2. b. Youth from majority-black neighborhoods are also overrepresented among youth arrested for disorderly conduct.

### i. We see the same pattern when examining arrests for disorderly conduct.

<<>>=
exec_psql("""
    SELECT
      SUM(CASE WHEN pct_black >= 50 THEN misdemeanor END) AS majority_black,
      SUM(CASE WHEN pct_black < 50 THEN misdemeanor END) AS majority_non_black
    FROM charges_2014 AS v 
    JOIN police_district_metadata AS met 
      ON v.dist_num = met.dist_num 
    WHERE offense LIKE 'DISORDERLY%'""")
