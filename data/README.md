## What's this?

In support of [Justice Divided](https://justicedivided.com), we crunched numbers on:

* Chicago's youth population;
* juvenile arrests in Chicago by police district (2014) and demographic (2013 - early 2017); and
* exits from the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice to Chicago ZIP codes (2009 - 2015).

 Now they're yours!

- If you want to refresh the provided output data, [census_area](https://github.com/datamade/census_area) (`pip install census_area`)
- [csvkit](https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit) (`pip install csvkit`)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) (`brew install postgresql`)

## Makin' data

Clone this repo and navigate to the `data/` dir in your terminal. From there you can [make the database](#make-the-database) or [remake the provided data, then make the database](#remake-provided-data-then-make-the-database).

### Make the database

```bash
make all
```

### Remake provided data, then make the database

‚ö†Ô∏è Re-running the Census script will take about 20 minutes. ‚ö†Ô∏è 

If you must, [get an API key](http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) for the U.S. Census. Then, from the `data/` dir, run this command:

```bash
cp scripts/config.py.example scripts/config.py
```

Add your Census API key to your freshly created `config.py`. 

Finally, run:

```bash
make clean # empties output/  
make all
```

## Data documentation

Running the provided scripts will generate two sorts of output: several CSVs, located in the `/output` directory, and a Postgres database called `jdiv`, containing those CSVs, plus some aggegregated, composite, and/or metadata tables for your convenience.
